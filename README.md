## How It works

Simple Setup: Start by inputting the number of participants in your Secret Santa exchange. Whether it's a small office or a large group of friends, the app can handle it all.

Enter Names and Emails: Provide the names and corresponding email addresses of all participants. We take privacy seriously, and your information is secure.

Fisher Yates Algorithm: Behind the scenes, the app employs the highly reliable Fisher Yates Algorithm to shuffle the names, guaranteeing a completely random order. This ensures that every participant will have a unique and surprise-filled experience.

Randomized Matches: The app takes care of pairing each participant with a partner in a way that is 100% randomized. No one will get themselves, and rest assured, no participant will receive the same person they had in a previous exchange.

Email Notifications: Once the matching process is complete, participants receive email notifications revealing their Secret Santa partner. The app makes the entire process transparent and easy to manage.
